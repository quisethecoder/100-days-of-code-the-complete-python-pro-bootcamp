# total = 0
#
# for number in range(0,101):
#     total += number
#
#
# print(total)

# for number in range(1, 101):
#     if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
#         print("fizzbuzz")
#     elif number % 5 == 0:
#         print("buzz")
#     elif number % 3 == 0:
#          print("fizz")
#     else:
#         print(number)

# Question 2:
# Write a simple for loop that goes through the list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# and prints the square of each number (i.e., number multiplied by itself).
# What do you think the output will be?
#
# Give these a try, and let me know your answers when you're ready!

# numbers = [1,2,3,4]
#
# multiply_me = 0
# for num in numbers:
#     multiply_me = num
#     if num:
#         print(multiply_me * num)

# Challenge Question:
# Write a for loop that goes through the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# and for each number prints the number and its double on the same line,
# separated by a space. For example, the output should be:

numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5]

times_itself = 0
for num in numbers:
    times_itself = num
    bun = times_itself * 2
    print(num, bun)
